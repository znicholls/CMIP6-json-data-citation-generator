// In order to try to get us on the same page, I've marked up this file
// For each key I classify them as either:
//   - compulsory i.e. must be in the json
//   - optional i.e. can be in the json, if optional then either
//     - independent i.e. does not require any other fields to also be present
//     - dependent i.e. if present, requires other fields to also be present
//       e.g. givenName only makes sense if familyName is also there. The
//       dependency is always on all other keys at the same level (if that
//       doesn't make sense let me know and I'll explain more)
//   - ignored i.e. should not be in the user's json as it will simply be
//     overwritten by the DOI client and hence including it in the user's json
//     adds nothing except confusion (people shouldn't know about more than
//     they need unless they go looking)
//   - autogenerated i.e. should not be in the user's json as it should be
//     automatically generated based off the netCDF file's attributes

The simulation data provides a basis for climate research designed to answer fundamental science questions, and the results will undoubtedly be relied on by authors of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR6).\r\n\r\nCMIP6 is a project coordinated by the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) as part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Phase 6 builds on previous phases executed under the leadership of the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and relies on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) and the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) along with numerous related activities for implementation. The original data is hosted and partially replicated at a federated collection of data nodes, and most of the data relied on by the IPCC is being archived for long-term preservation at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC) hosted by World Data Centre for Climate (WDCC) at DKRZ.\r\n\r\nThe project includes simulations from about 90 global climate models and around 40 institutions and organizations worldwide. - Project website: https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6  \r\n\r\nThe Earth System Model IPSL-CM6A-LR, released in 2017, includes the components:\r\n  atmos: LMDZ (NPv6, N96; 144 x 143 longitude/latitude; 79 levels; top level 40000 m), land: ORCHIDEE (v2.0, Water/Carbon/Energy mode), ocean: NEMO-OPA (eORCA1.3, tripolar primarily 1deg; 362 x 332 longitude/latitude; 75 levels; top grid cell 0-2 m), ocnBgchem: NEMO-PISCES, seaIce: NEMO-LIM3. \r\nThe model was run by the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, Paris 75252, France (IPSL) in nominal resolutions: atmos: 250 km, land: 250 km, ocean: 100 km, ocnBgchem: 100 km, seaIce: 100 km. \r\n\r"
